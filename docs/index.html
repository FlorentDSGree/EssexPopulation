	<div class="title2">1. Introduction</div>
	<p>The purpose of this study is to give some basic information about the population in Essex (UK county). Essex is a county in the region 
	   East of England located in the South-East of England. According to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex'>wikipedia</a>, the population 
	   of Essex was 1,832,752 (mid-2019 est.) with an area of 3,670 km2. The data are coming from different open source platform: 
	   <a href="https://osdatahub.os.uk">area boundaries</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk">population</a>. The analysis and visualisation are 
	   done with python using the libraries "bokeh" and "matplotlib" for the visualisation.</p>
    <div class="title2">2. Population by local authorities</div>
	<p>Essex is made of 14 ceremonial counties comprised of 12 non-metropolitan counties and 2 unitary authorities (Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock).</p>

	<!-- </div> -->
	<p>The South and North-East of Essex are the most populated part of the county. Southend-on-Sea and Harlow are the most densely populated areas. 
	   Some ward having a sea shore have a part of their area on the sea, this leads to approximate population density calculation as these areas are 
	   uninhabitable. As next step, a smaller division of the areas must be used for a more accurate analysis.</p>
