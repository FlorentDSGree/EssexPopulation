	<div class="title1">Statistics and visualisation of population in Essex (UK)</div>
	<div class="title2">1. Introduction</div>
	<p>The purpose of this study is to give some basic information about the population in Essex (UK county). Essex is a county in the region 
	   East of England located in the South-East of England. According to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex'>wikipedia</a>, the population 
	   of Essex was 1,832,752 (mid-2019 est.) with an area of 3,670 km2. The data are coming from different open source platform: 
	   <a href="https://osdatahub.os.uk">area boundaries</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk">population</a>. The analysis and visualisation are 
	   done with python using the libraries "bokeh" and "matplotlib" for the visualisation.</p>
    <div class="title2">2. Population by local authorities</div>
	<p>Essex is made of 14 ceremonial counties comprised of 12 non-metropolitan counties and 2 unitary authorities (Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock).</p>

	<p>The South and North-East of Essex are the most populated part of the county. Southend-on-Sea and Harlow are the most densely populated areas. 
	   Some ward having a sea shore have a part of their area on the sea, this leads to approximate population density calculation as these areas are 
	   uninhabitable. As next step, a smaller division of the areas must be used for a more accurate analysis.</p>

	<p>In city centre, the proximity to a station is good. Moving away from the centre, some zones are less close to stations especially 
	   in the South-West, North-West and North-East of the town. The South-East keeps a good proximity thanks to the station Poterie.</p>

	<p>This map shows the accessibility to Velo Star service based on the distance and number of base per station. The city centre has the 
	   highest accessibility while moving away reduce the accessibility. Despite the distance to the city centre, the accessibility can be 
	   very high at immediate proximity to stations.</p>
